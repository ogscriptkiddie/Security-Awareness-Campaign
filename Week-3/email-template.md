**Subject: Beware of Manipulation – Social Engineering Tactics!**  

Hello Team,  

This week, we are focusing on **social engineering**, a deceptive technique where cybercriminals trick individuals into revealing confidential information.  

## Common Social Engineering Tactics:  
✔ **Pretexting** – A scammer pretends to be someone you trust.  
✔ **Baiting** – Offering something tempting (like free USBs with malware).  
✔ **Tailgating** – Unauthorized individuals sneaking into restricted areas.  

**Stay Alert** – Always verify identities and report suspicious interactions!  

Best regards,
