Subject: Keep Your Accounts Safe: Update Your Passwords

Hello Team,

This week, we focus on password hygiene. A strong password is the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts.

## Tips for Creating Strong Passwords:
- Use at least 12 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid using easily guessable information like names or birthdates.

If you need help managing your passwords, consider using a password manager.

Best regards,
